<h1>Introduction to Linked Lists</h1>
<p>
    Linked List is a very commonly used linear data structure which consists of group of nodes in a sequence.
</p>

<p>Each node holds its own data and the address of the next node hence forming a chain like structure.</p>

<p>Linked Lists are used to create trees and graphs.</p>

<h1>Advantages of Linked Lists</h1>

<ol type="i">
    <li>They are a dynamic in nature which allocates the memory when required.</li>
    <li>Insertion and deletion operations can be easily implemented.</li>
    <li>Stacks and queues can be easily executed.</li>
    <li>Linked List reduces the access time.</li>
</ol><br>

<h1>Disadvantages of Linked Lists</h1>

<ol type="i">
    <li>The memory is wasted as pointers require extra memory for storage.</li>
    <li>No element can be accessed randomly; it has to access each node sequentially.</li>
    <li>Reverse Traversing is difficult in linked list.</li>
</ol><br>

<h1>Applications of Linked Lists</h1>

<ol type="i">
    <li>Linked lists are used to implement stacks, queues, graphs, etc.</li>
    <li>Linked lists let you insert elements at the beginning and end of the list.</li>
    <li>In Linked Lists we don't need to know the size in advance.</li>
</ol><br>

<h1>Types of Linked Lists</h1>
<p>There are 3 different implementations of Linked List available, they are:</p>

<h1>1.Singly Linked List</h1>
<p>
    Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a data part as well as an address part i.e. next, which points to the next node in the sequence of nodes.
</p>

<p>The operations we can perform on singly linked lists are insertion, deletion and traversal.</p>

<h1>2.Doubly Linked List</h1>
<p>
    In a doubly linked list, each node contains a data part and two addresses, one for the previous node and one for the next node.

<h1>3.Circular Linked List</h1>
<p>
    In circular linked list the last node of the list holds the address of the first node hence forming a circular chain.
