<h1>Binary Search Tree</h1>
<p>A binary search tree is a useful data structure for fast addition and removal of data.</p>

<p>
    It is composed of nodes, which stores data and also links to upto two other child nodes. It is the relationship between the leaves linked to and the linking leaf, also known as the parent node, which makes the binary tree such an efficient data structure.
</p>

<p>
    For a binary tree to be a binary search tree, the data of all the nodes in the left sub-tree of the root node should be less than the data of the root. The data of all the nodes in the right subtree of the root node should be greater than equal to the
    data of the root. As a result, the leaves on the farthest left of the tree have the lowest values, whereas the leaves on the right of the tree have the greatest values.
</p>

<p>A representation of binary search tree looks like the following:</p>

<img src="articles\data_structures\ds_binarysearchtree\1.png"></img>

<p>
    Consider the root node 20. All elements to the left of subtree(10, 5) are less than 20 and all elements to the right of subtree(25, 30, 35) are greater than 20.
</p><br>

<h1>Implementation of BST</h1>
<p>First, define a struct as tree_node. It will store the data and pointers to left and right subtree.</p>

<code class="block">struct tree_node
{
	int data;
	tree_node *left, *right;
};</code><br>

<p>
    The node itself is very similar to the node in a linked list. A basic knowledge of the code for a linked list will be very helpful in understanding the techniques of binary trees.
</p>

<p>
    It is most logical to create a binary search tree class to encapsulate the workings of the tree into a single area, and also making it reusable. The class will contain functions to insert data into the tree, search if the data is present and methods for
    traversing the tree.
</p>

<code class="block">class BST
{
	tree_node *root;
	void insert(tree_node* , int );
	bool search(int , tree_node* );
	void inorder(tree_node* );
	void preorder(tree_node* );
	void postorder(tree_node* );

	public:
	BST()
	{
		root = NULL;
	}
	void insert(int );
	bool search(int key);
    void inorder();
    void preorder();
    void postorder();
};</code><br>

<p>
    It is necessary to initialize root to NULL for the later functions to be able to recognize that it does not exist.
</p>

<p>
    All the public members of the class are designed to allow the user of the class to use the class without dealing with the underlying design. The functions which will be called recursively are the ones which are private, allowing them to travel down the
    tree.
</p><br>

<h1>Insertion in a BST</h1>
<p>
    To insert data into a binary tree involves a function searching for an unused node in the proper position in the tree in which to insert the key value. The insert function is generally a recursive function that continues moving down the levels of a binary
    tree until there is an unused leaf in a position which follows the following rules of placing nodes.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Compare data of the root node and element to be inserted.</li>

    <li>
        If the data of the root node is greater, and if a left subtree exists, then repeat step 1 with root = root of left subtree. Else,
    </li>

    <li>Insert element as left child of current root.</li>

    <li>
        If the data of the root node is greater, and if a right subtree exists, then repeat step 1 with root = root of right subtree.
    </li>

    <li>Else, insert element as right child of current root.</li>
</ul>

<img src="articles\data_structures\ds_binarysearchtree\4.png"></img>

<code class="block">void BST :: insert(tree_node *node, int d)
{
	// element to be inserted is lesser than node’s data
	if(d < node->data)
	{
		// if left subtree is present
		if(node->left != NULL)
			insert(node->left, d);
		
		// create new node
		else
		{
			node->left = new tree_node;
			node->left->data = d;
			node->left->left = NULL;
			node->left->right = NULL;
		}
	}

	// element to be inserted is greater than node’s data
	else if(d >= node->data)
	{
		// if left subtree is present
		if(node->right != NULL)
			insert(node->right, d);
		
		// create new node
		else
		{
			node->right = new tree_node;
			node->right->data = d;
			node->right->left = NULL;
			node->right->right = NULL;
		}
	}
	
}</code><br>

<p>
    Since the root node is a private member, we also write a public member function which is available to non-members of the class. It calls the private recursive function to insert an element and also takes care of the case when root node is NULL.
</p>

<code class="block">void BST::insert(int d)
{
	if(root!=NULL)
                insert(root, d);
	else
    {
        root = new tree_node;
        root->data = d;
        root->left = NULL;
        root->right = NULL;
    }
}</code><br>

<h1>Searching in a BST</h1>
<p>
    The search function works in a similar fashion as insert. It will check if the key value of the current node is the value to be searched. If not, it should check to see if the value to be searched for is less than the value of the node, in which case
    it should be recursively called on the left child node, or if it is greater than the value of the node, it should be recursively called on the right child node.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Compare data of the root node and the value to be searched.</li>

    <li>
        If the data of the root node is greater, and if a left subtree exists, then repeat step 1 with root = root of left subtree. Else,
    </li>

    <li>
        If the data of the root node is greater, and if a right subtree exists, then repeat step 1 with root = root of right subtree. Else,
    </li>

    <li>If the value to be searched is equal to the data of root node, return true.</li>

    <li>Else, return false.</li>
</ul>

<code class="block">bool BST::search(int d, tree_node *node)
{
	bool ans = false;

	// node is not present
  	if(node == NULL)
 		return false;
	
	// Node’s data is equal to value searched
    if(d == node->data)
      	return true;
	
	// Node’s data is greater than value searched
    else if(d < node->data)
       	ans = search(d, node->left);

	// Node’s data is lesser than value searched
    else
       	ans = search(d, node->right);
  
    return ans;
}</code><br>

<p>
    Since the root node is a private member, we also write a public member function which is available to non-members of the class. It calls the private recursive function to search an element and also takes care of the case when root node is NULL.
</p>

<code class="block">bool BST::search(int d)
{
	if(root ==  NULL)
		return false;
	else	
		return  search(d, root);
}</code><br>

<h1>Traversing in a BST</h1>
<p>There are mainly three types of tree traversals:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Pre-order Traversal:</li>

    <p>In this technique, we do the following :</p>

    <ul type="circle">
        <li>Process data of root node.</li>
        <li>First, traverse left subtree completely.</li>
        <li>Then, traverse right subtree.</li>
    </ul>
    <code class="block">void BST :: preorder(tree_node *node)
{
	if(node !=  NULL)
    {
		cout<<node->data<<endl;
       	preorder(node->left);
       	preorder(node->right);
    }
}
</code><br>

    <li>Post-order Traversal</li>

    <p>In this traversal technique we do the following:</p>

    <ul type="circle">
        <li>First traverse left subtree completely.</li>
        <li>Then, traverse right subtree completely.</li>
        <li>Then, process data of node.</li>
    </ul>
    <code class="block">void BST :: postorder(tree_node *node)
{
	if(node !=  NULL)
   	{
        postorder(node->left);
        postorder(node->right);
	    cout&lt;&lt;node-&gt;data&lt;&lt;endl;
   	}
}
</code><br>

    <li>In-order Traversal</li>

    <p>In in-order traversal, we do the following:</p>

    <ul type="circle">
        <li>First process left subtree.</li>
        <li>Then, process current root node.</li>
        <li>Then, process right subtree.</li>
    </ul>
    <code class="block">void BST :: inorder(tree_node *node)
{
	if(node !=  NULL)
   	{
        inorder(node->left);
	    cout<&lt;node->data<&lt;endl;
        inorder(node->right);
   	}
}
</code>
</ul><br>

<p>
    The in-order traversal of a binary search tree gives a sorted ordering of the data elements that are present in the binary search tree. This is an important property of a binary search tree.
</p>

<p>
    Since the root node is a private member, we also write public member functions which is available to non-members of the class. It calls the private recursive function to traverse the tree and also takes care of the case when root node is NULL.
</p>

<code class="block">void BST :: preorder()
{
	if(root ==  NULL)
		cout<<"TREE IS  EMPTY\n";
	else
       	preorder(root);
}

void BST :: postorder()
{
	if(root ==  NULL)
		cout<<"TREE IS  EMPTY\n";
	else
	    postorder(root);
}

void BST :: inorder()
{
	if(root == NULL)
		cout<<"TREE IS EMPTY\n";
	else
		inorder(root);
}</code><br>

<p>
    The time complexity of search and insert rely on the height of the tree. On average, binary search trees with n nodes have O(log n) height. However in the worst case the tree can have a height of O(n) when the unbalanced tree resembles a linked list.
    For example in this case :

<p>Traversal requires O(n) time, since every node must be visited.</p>
