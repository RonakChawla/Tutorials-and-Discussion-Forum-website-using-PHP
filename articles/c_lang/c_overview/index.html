<p>
	C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
</p>

<p>
	In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
</p>

<p>
	The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons −
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Easy to learn</li>
    <li>Structured language</li>
    <li>It produces efficient programs</li>
    <li>It can handle low-level activities</li>
    <li>It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms</li>
</ul><br>

<h1>Facts about C</h1>

<ul>
	<li>C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.</li>
	<li>C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.</li>
	<li>The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).</li>
	<li>The UNIX OS was totally written in C.</li>
	<li>Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.</li>
	<li>Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.</li>
	<li>Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.</li>
</ul><br>

<h1>Why use C?</h1>
<p>
	C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be −
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Operating Systems</li>
    <li>Language Compilers</li>
    <li>Assemblers</li>
    <li>Text Editors</li>
    <li>Print Spoolers</li>
    <li>Network Drivers</li>
    <li>Modern Programs</li>
    <li>Databases</li>
    <li>Language Interpreters</li>
    <li>Utilities</li>
</ul><br>

<h1>C Programs</h1>
<p>
	A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.

	This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.
